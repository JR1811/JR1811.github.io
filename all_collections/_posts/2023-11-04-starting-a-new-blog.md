Today I was thinking about learning something new. So why not start out with something easy and create a new blog, where I will occasionally post my thoughts and things that I want to remember in the future and might be mildly interesting to other people.

Please keep in mind, that I am not a native English speaker. I will most certainly make spelling mistakes, but I hope, that it will be bearable.

# About me

Currently, a university student in Germany and am 23 y/o.

- I do have experience in developing software
- I play [computer games](https://steamcommunity.com/id/JR1811/)
- I like [Anime, Mangas, Manwhas](https://myanimelist.net/profile/ShiroJR), etc.
- I really like skiing
- I used to play a Bassoon for over 10 ears

I like to expand my horizon in most random topics. Over the past few years, I did some [photography](https://www.instagram.com/jan.reshiro/), had 3D projects in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), did a little bit of sound design, made pixelart for my current GameDev (Fabric modding) projects and did re-drawing work for the [Artificial Demons](https://mangadex.org/group/6947059b-1533-43bb-94a6-42fae852bdba/artificial-demons) Manga scanlation group.

Besides that, I am a pretty boring person.

# About this blog

In general, I was looking for a better online presence besides social-media and was going to build my own site. However, thinking about all the boilerplate work in terms of HTML, CSS and JS, even with using things like react or Vue, I never really started to develop such a thing.

With my current work on the [Fabric community wiki](https://fabric.mineblock11.dev/sounds/) I was introduced to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which can be used to write blogs using not only HTML but also Markdown. Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for taking university lecture notes and writing software in general, I am used to Markdown's features, which will hopefully speed up the process of writing posts like these. For hosting this project, I think, I will stick to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Now I only need to find stuff, that I want to write about in here. ðŸ˜•
